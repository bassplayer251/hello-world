# hello-world
beginning linked data project for hcls website

OK, to get this party started I'm going to put in my notes from Lauri's demo / phone call 1/31/2020:
We need to know about Data Citations. In Novelist Select, we have access to List, Category, and Navigate - at henry.library.link, Navigate is at the top under Services pulldown menu. If we want to pull ISBN numbers, we can use the right side, ID Navigator. If we want to pull John Irving books, use the Resource Navigator on the left and type "John Irving" Then you can select one of the results and grab the code at the end of the URL to paste in to GitHub to create your JSON file. You may have to grab multiple URLs and paste in to JSON file to get the results you're looking for.

After using GitHub to create JSON file, you've got to also use JSON Validator (Google this) to make sure you've created the file properly. To create your own mix you take the "raw" from github and add the URL for that "raw" to the end of the URL for your Collections page. The resulting link should give you the option to create the carousel and grab the embed file for the library website.

Some will be lists (Those use ISBN numbers), some will be Mixes (those use Bibframe Resources). Lists are simplest, or choosing different categories is also simple.
